Welcome to Nanny-On Open Source Project
=======================================

Nanny-On is an application control program taking advantage of adaptive whitelisting technologies.
Generally, application control programs enhance security features and availability of
embedded systems such as POS, CD/ATM, ICS(Industrial Control System), etc.
However, we wish to extend the target system to personal and server computers.
Nanny-On project is to implement and maintain application control software for Linux kernels.

You are always welcomed to join this project.

This project is sponsored by [NIPA] to promote Open Source Software development.
